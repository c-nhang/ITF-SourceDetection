It's based on the principle that nodes that can spread information more effectively are more central.\n\nAssume that a rumor was spread on an online social network according to the *susceptible-infected* (SI) model. Given a rumor subgraph (all vertices in the subgraph knew the rumor), how to accurately identify the rumor culprit?\n\n### Rumor Center\n\nThe rumor spreading follows the SI model, in which once a vertex is \"infected\", it stays in this state forever. Let $V_I$ denote the set of vertices such that each vertex in $V_I$ has at least one infected neighbor. In each time slot, one vertex is uniformly chosen from $V_I$ to be the next infected vertex. Given a snapshot of $N$ infected vertices $G_N$, we want to find\n$$\nR_C = \\arg \\max_{v\\in G_N}P(G_N|v),\n$$\nwhere $R_C$ is the rumor center and $P(G_N|v)$ is the probability of having $G_N$ under the SI model assuming $v$ is the rumor source.",
