Current approach of the project does not account for temporal changes in the network topology, which can significantly affect rumor spread and source detection.\n\n* Multi-source Rumors: In reality, rumors can originate from multiple sources, yet our methods are designed to identify a single source. Multi-source detection is a more complex problem that requires additional methodological development.\n\n* Validation and Verification: The validation of the algorithms against empirical data is a challenging task. Ensuring that the algorithms not only work well with synthetic data but also accurately represent real-world scenarios is critical for their application.\n\n* Ethical Considerations: Implications of the project in terms of privacy, especially in the context of contact tracing, require careful consideration. Ethical guidelines and privacy-preserving mechanisms should be an integral part of the development process.",
