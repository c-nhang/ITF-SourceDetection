## Objectives
The objectives of this project could be summarized as follows:
* To provide an organized compendium of interactive notebooks that serve as educational resources on network science, specifically tailored towards rumor source detection for infodemic risk management.
* To introduce the concept of network centrality and its application in understanding the dynamics of information spread within networks.
* To demonstrate the use of digital contact tracing as a means for source detection through a simulator that can model the spread of information.
* To present the distance-based source estimator as an analytical tool for identifying the origins of information spread in a network.
* To discuss the limitations inherent in the current methods and models of source detection and faked news invalidation, opening a dialogue for improvement and further research.
* To facilitate a hands-on learning experience for users, enabling them to interact with and manipulate network data for better comprehension of the methodologies discussed.
* To contribute to the global effort against misinformation by equipping researchers, practitioners, and students with the necessary analytical skills to tackle the infodemic.
